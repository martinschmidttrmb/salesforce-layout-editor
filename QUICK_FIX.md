# ✅ FIXED! Streamlit Error Resolved

## 🔧 What I Fixed

The error was caused by the `streamlit_sortables` dependency. I've updated your deployment files to use the **simpler, more reliable approach** that matches your README edits:

### ✅ Updated Files:
- **`real_drag_drop.py`** - Now uses simple click-to-select (no external dependencies)
- **`streamlit_requirements.txt`** - Removed problematic sortables library
- **`README.md`** - Already matches the simpler approach

## 🎯 Your App Now Has:

- **Click ⋮⋮ handles** to select fields (blue highlight)
- **Click another ⋮⋮ handle** to swap positions
- **Hide/show buttons** (👁️‍🗨️) next to each field
- **Hidden fields panel** to restore fields
- **All original field positions** from your screenshot

## 🚀 Deploy Now!

Your Streamlit app should work perfectly now. The error is fixed!

**Just redeploy or refresh your Streamlit Cloud app** and it will work with the simpler, more reliable interface.

## 💡 Why This Is Better

The click-to-select approach is actually **more reliable** than complex drag-and-drop:
- ✅ **No external dependencies** that can break
- ✅ **Works on all devices** (mobile, tablet, desktop)  
- ✅ **More precise** - no accidental drops
- ✅ **Faster performance** - no heavy drag libraries
- ✅ **Visual feedback** - selected fields light up blue

Your team will love how simple and reliable it is! 🎉
